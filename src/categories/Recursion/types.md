Yes üëç ‚Äî all the problems you listed can be solved with **backtracking** (or DFS with pruning). But they belong to **different categories** based on the structure of the solution space. Let me organize them clearly for you:

---

## üîπ Categories of Backtracking Problems

### **1. Subsets, Combinations, Permutations (Tree-diagram based)**

These are the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù backtracking problems, where you draw a **recursion tree**.

* **Subsets** (include/exclude each element ‚Üí `2^N`)

  * [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)
  * [Subsets II (with duplicates)](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)
  * [Letter Case Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-case-permutation/)

* **Combinations** (choose `k` elements from `n`)

  * [Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/)
  * [Combination Sum (candidates repeatedly)](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)
  * [Combination Sum II (candidates once)](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/)
  * [Combination Sum III (fixed length, no array)](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/)
  * [Iterator for Combination](https://leetcode.com/problems/iterator-for-combination/)

* **Permutations** (arrange elements ‚Üí `N!`)

  * [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)
  * [Permutations II (with duplicates)](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/)
  * \[String Permutations] (same logic as array)
  * [Palindrome Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-permutation-ii/)

üëâ **Time complexity summary:**

* Subsets ‚Üí `O(2^N)`
* Combinations ‚Üí `O(N! / (k!(N-k)!))`
* Permutations ‚Üí `O(N!)`

---

### **2. Grid / Path Search Problems**

Backtracking explores paths on a **grid/board** by marking visited cells and undoing the move.

* [Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/) (DFS with marking `'#'`)
* [Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/) (stop when solution found)
* [N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)
* [N-Queens II](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/)

---

### **3. Partitioning / String Breaking Problems**

These involve **splitting a string** into valid parts. Each recursive call decides where to cut.

* [Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/) (get all partitions)
* [Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)
* [Restore IP Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)
* [Remove Invalid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-invalid-parentheses/)
* [Maximum Length of Concatenated String with Unique Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/)

‚ö° Note:

* **Word Break I** is mostly **DP** (not pure backtracking).
* **Palindrome Partitioning II** = DFS + memoization.

---

### **4. Graph / Transformation Problems**

Here, backtracking or DFS explores transformations between states (words, patterns).

* [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/) (BFS preferred)
* [Word Ladder II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/) (BFS + backtracking to reconstruct paths)

---

### **5. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**

Here, you try to assign values under certain **constraints**.

* [N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/) (row/col/diagonal constraints)
* [Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/) (digit placement rules)
* [Android Unlock Patterns](https://leetcode.com/problems/android-unlock-patterns/) (jump constraints)

---

## üîπ Big Picture

So your list fits into **6 categories**:

1. **Subsets / Combinations / Permutations** ‚Üí Recursion tree
2. **Grid / Path Search** ‚Üí DFS on board
3. **Partitioning / String Breaking** ‚Üí Recursive string splitting
4. **Graph Transformations** ‚Üí DFS/BFS + backtracking
5. **Constraint Satisfaction** ‚Üí Placement problems (N-Queens, Sudoku, Android unlock)
6. **Expression Problems** ‚Üí Parentheses removal, expression restore

üëâ A good mental model:

* **Tree-style recursion** = Subsets / Combinations / Permutations
* **Path-style recursion** = Word Search, Grid problems
* **Cutting-style recursion** = Word Break, Palindrome Partitioning
* **State-transition recursion** = Word Ladder, Graph problems
* **Constraint-style recursion** = N-Queens, Sudoku
