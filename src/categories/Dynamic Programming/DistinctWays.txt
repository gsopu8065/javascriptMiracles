This is not DP, this is more of recursion and Backtracking

Basic Recursion:
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum [recursion with memory]

DFS + Backtracking:
https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum  [DP]
https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii [equal subset + minimum logic]
https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/ [Same as word break II]
