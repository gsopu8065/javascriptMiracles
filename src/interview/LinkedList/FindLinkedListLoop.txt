Algorithm: Find Linked list has a loop or not

step1: create two pointers (fast and slow) point to head
step2: traverse fast by two nodes, slow by one node till either slow == fast or fast != null
   while( fast != null && fast.next != null)
   {
      fast = fast->next->next;
      slow = slow->next;
      if(fast == slow)
       break;
   }
step3: if fast == null ---> no meeting point
step4: else it has a loop
