Algorithm: median of streaming elements
median of [1,2,3] is 2
median of [23,45,67,89,76,54,56] is 89
median of [23,45,67,89, 2, 76,54,56] is (89 + 2)/2

step1: create two stacks old stack and new stack
step2: push new element to new stack
step3: if new stack is bigger than old stack
          return new stack peek
        else
          (new stack peek + old stack peek)/2
